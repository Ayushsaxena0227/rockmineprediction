# rockmineprediction

## Overview
This project uses machine learning to classify objects as either sonar (rock) or mine based on their features. The dataset used is the Sonar dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, feature scaling, and data splitting.
- **Model Training**: Trains a machine learning model to classify sonar and mine objects.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluates the model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.
- **Visualization**: Provides visualizations for data exploration and model performance.

## Dataset
The dataset used is the Sonar dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains 208 instances, each with 60 features, and a label indicating whether the object is a rock or a mine.
